Greyscale facsimile of one of the oldest extant notated liturgical manuscripts of the Netherlands. Contains an antiphonary and tonary. Written in Utrecht in the late 12th century, probably for the chapter church of St. Maryâ€™s. It employs a subtle staff notation that besides expressing the normal modal system, includes devices for indicating chromatic alteration and micro-chromatic tones. Introduction by Ike de Loos. Index by Charles Downey. Edited by Ruth Steiner.
