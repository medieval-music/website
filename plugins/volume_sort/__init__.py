all the volumes in a series. This integer is added to the "volume_sort" field.

# We multiply the different parts of the volume number by a different factor in order to consider

# volume part number is large enough that the volume part letter won't interfere.

# Description of the parts of the volume number:
#     Volume 42/6b

#     - 6 is the "volume part number"
