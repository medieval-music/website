# THIS FILE IS IN YAML FORMAT!!
# Failing to follow the YAML structure will result in a parse error
# See https://learntheweb.courses/topics/markdown-yaml-cheat-sheet/#yaml

# List of words to ignore at the start when sorting
# Each line MUST start with a dash
# Enclosing the word in quotes is strongly recommended to avoid errors when parsing

# EXAMPLES:
# - "A" is OK
# - A is OK
# - "Some Word" is OK
# - Some Word could fail to parse
# - "true" is OK
# - true may not be parsed as a string and could cause problems
# A (without the leading -) is NOT OK

- "a"
- "an"
- "la"
- "le"
- "les"
- "of"
- "on"
- "the"
