# THIS FILE IS IN YAML FORMAT!!
# Failing to follow the YAML structure will result in a parse error

# Lists of additional names for series
# In the format:
# "folder_name":
#  - "Additional Series Name"
# Each section starts with the key of the series the names are for (either a folder in books/ or other series front matter).
# Then followed by indented lines starting with a dash with the additional names for the series
# Enclosing the title in quotes is strongly recommended to avoid errors when parsing

# "new_series":
#   - "Another Title"
# "foo":
#   - "Other Title"

"collected_works":
  - "Gesamtausgaben"
"manuscripts":
