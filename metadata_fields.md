Metadata Fields for Book Entries
================================

- series (full series name, must match exactly)

- author (full name, last name first)

- editor (full name, last name first)

- volume

- volume_part (e.g., the "2" in XVII/2)

- price (in euros, just a number without euro sign)

- isbn10 (old numbers, as printed in the older books)

- isbn13

- pages (without units; the system will add pp. when it generates the
record)

- plates

- year

- place

- publisher

- size (in centimeters, but I'm not putting in the unit - just the number)

- corrigenda (sometimes an explanation, and sometimes pages that need to be
available for download - how to do this?)
