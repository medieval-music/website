Greyscale facsimile of an important antiphonal of Sarum use, prepared for a non-monastic Welsh church in the mid-14th century. Its name, “Penpont Antiphonal,” is after the manor of that name in south Wales with which it was connected and where is was kept until its sale at a Sotheby auction in 1960. Introduction and indices prepared by Owain Tudor Edwards.
