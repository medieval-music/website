		<h1>Institute of Mediaeval Music</h1>

<p>The Institute of Mediaeval Music is a small Canadian press devoted to publishing academic books
about all aspects of music in the Middle Ages. Series include
<a href="/series#manuscripts">“Publications of Mediæval Musical Manuscripts”</a>,
<a href="/series#in_translation">“Musical Theorists in Translation,”</a>
<a href="/series#collected_works">“Collected Works”</a>, and
<a href="/series#studies">“Musicological Studies”</a>.
The simple, distinctive hardbound covers identify each series by colour: black, red, blue, and
green, respectively.</p>

<p>Founded by Prof. Luther Dittmer in 1954, the Institute of Mediaeval Music was directed by
Dr. Bryan Gillingham from 1985 to 2016, first in Ottawa, ON and after 2011 in Lions Bay, BC.
In 2016–17, operations were transferred to Dr. Debra Lacoste, and the Institute has now moved
back to Ontario.</p>

<p>The earliest volumes produced by Prof. Dittmer are now being distributed through the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">American Institute of Musicology &lt;http://www.corpusmusicae.com/&gt;</code>_. The approximately 200 books
published by Dr. Bryan Gillingham over his three decades as Director are available in the current
IMM list on this website. For details of print status and pricing,
please consult the appropriate Series pages.</p>
